This game is a really low quality python pygame game.
Please note that this is my first game and you have to own Python 3 to play it.

You can download Python for Windows (x64) here here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.8/python-3.10.8-amd64.exe (direct link to .exe file)
Other OS Versions can be downloaded from python.org/downloads.

Also, don't change the name of the original Folder or the game will not run.

This game is still in developement, so any sugeestions would be great and appreciated.
